# Godot STEX to PNG Converter

A command-line tool for converting `.stex` image files from the Godot Engine into standard `.png` images by stripping the first 32-byte header.

## ðŸ§  What is a `.stex` File?

Godotâ€™s `.stex` files are texture files used internally by the engine. These files have a 32-byte header that must be removed to obtain a valid `.png` file. This script handles that process automatically.
